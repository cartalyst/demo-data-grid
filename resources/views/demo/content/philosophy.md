## Philosophy

Data filtration over pagination.

We wanted to create a package that would not only simplify front end side of presenting a data set, but make it easy to handle any data set in general.

No matter what is the use case, data-grid's goal is to help you manage and manipulate your data set.

We completely rewrote data-grid to be very flexible and extendable for a wide range of use cases, from creating a full-fledged facets enabled e-commerce catalog to internal use of data-grid for your backend.
